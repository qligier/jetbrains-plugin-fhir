Reports ids that aren't based on the item's name.
<p>
    If the item has a name, the id SHOULD be based on the item's name, with '_' replaced by '-', changed to lowercase, and truncated if necessary.
    The overall length MUST NOT be more than 64 characters (per the requirements of the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#primitive">FHIR id datatype</a>).
