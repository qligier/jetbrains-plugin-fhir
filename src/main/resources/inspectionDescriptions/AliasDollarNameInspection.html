Reports alias names that don't begin with the $ sign.
<p>
    In contrast with other names in FSH (for profiles, extensions, etc.), alias names optionally begin with a dollar sign ($).
    If you define an alias with a leading $, implementations can more easily check for misspellings.
    For example, if you choose the alias name $RaceAndEthnicity and accidentally type $RaceEthnicity, implementations can easily detect there is no alias by that name.
    Without the $ sign, implementations are forced to look through FHIR Core and all external implementation guides for anything with that name or id, or in some contexts, assume it is a new item, with unpredictable results.
